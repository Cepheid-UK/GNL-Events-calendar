ON REPEAT:
1. get all the events in the calendar ✅
2. get all the events in the spreadsheet ✅
3. format the info from the spreadsheet into events in an array ✅, including formatting their time to ISO - IN PROGRESS
4. for each event in the spreadsheet, check to see if there is an event in the calendar for the two players
5a. IF NO to 5 - There has not been an event created for this match, create it and use the time on the spreadsheet.
5b. IF YES to 5 - An event exists for these players, but the spreadsheet says a different time
     add the new event using the spreadsheet's time, and delete the old one.


1. loop through all spreadsheet matches
2a. inside this loop, loop through all calendar matches
2b. use regex to get p1 and p2 from the calendar event title
3. check if the date for two matches is the same
3a. if yes, check if player 1 is the same
3b. if yes, check if player 2 is the same (I guess this is just belt and braces)
4. if all yes, don't do anything
5. if either no - create event
6. pass time, player 1 and player 2 to createEvent()
7. add the result to an array
8. return array of all events that need to be added to the calendar
